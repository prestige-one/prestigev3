            <ol className="po-legal-doc-list po-legal-doc-list--numbered">
              <li>
                Whenever we require your consent for the processing of your personal information such processing will be
                justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679
                (&lsquo;GDPR&rsquo;). This article in the GDPR describes when processing can be done lawfully.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the processing of your personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and
                Prestige Developments or for taking any pre-contractual steps upon your request, such processing will be
                based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit (b). If this data is not processed, Prestige Developments will not be
                able to execute the contract with you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Where the processing is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation, we will process your

              </li>
              <li>
                And where the processing is necessary for the purposes of Prestige Development&rsquo;s legitimate
                interests, such processing will be made in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1) lit (f), for example to detect
                fraud.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may also receive personalised advertising where you indicate to Prestige Developments specific
